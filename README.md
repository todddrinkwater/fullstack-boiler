# signhere
A basic application designed to collect peoples signatures along with signed contracts.

## User Stories
As a user, I would like to:
- Be able to receive a contract, sign it with my touchpad, mouse or touch screen
- Return contract to the sender to be stored in their database.
- Have a shared area where you can view what contracts you've signed and with who.
- Stretch Goal: To be sent an email copy of that contract and/or be able to have it saved on the signhere application.
